A comprehensive kit to explore, learn and make Internet of Things (IoT), Robotics, Smart Agriculture and a lot more . Kit is intended for teachers, students ,hobbyist and makers. 

Need of the hour is to promote DIY culture in the country. Not as a subject or course but as a hobby just like a new sport.
This probably would be the last piece of hardware you need to start your glorious journey in the fascinating field of  Robotics, Embedded Systems and IoT. Unfortunately most of the enthusiast loose interest in the very beginning due to couple of reasons. 

-Limited or no exposure with the hardware – While dealing with the prototyping hardware issues like loose connection, reverse polarity, difference in operating voltages are common and hard to debug if you are a newbie or sometimes for experts as well.

-Lack of Integrated Sensors - All the popular prototyping hardware like Arduino ,BluePill, ESP even the latest Raspberry pi Pico comes with no sensors on board or just with an LED. In one universe it’s a flexible design ,one can integrate any desired sensor. In the other universe it’s a nightmare for inexperience enthusiasts. 

-Lack of consolidated resources – Internet is BOON and BANE both at the same time. One can find unlimited resources on a sensor or piece of hardware. But finding an authentic and reliable information and making it run is another story all together.
